## Ad removing browser extensions

If you are using a chromium based browser that is not chrome, I recommend going into extension settings and making it so that you can download extensions from the chrome web store. This will make it much easier to install many extensions not available on the Opera or Edge web stores. If an extension is not available on the firefox web store, you can often download it from the github, and install it manually.

# Android

## About

Adblocking on Android is quite a bit different than adblocking on browser. On browser, you can simply install some browser extensions, and you are set to go. However on Android, removing ads it a bit more unconventional. In this list I will list some different types of adblockers. Also, all these apps will either be from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), or the developers website/discord. 
I highly recommend you install F-Droid as it is useful for much more than just Ad-free apps. 

## System Wide

These adblockers block ads in most apps. This includes ads in those crappy games you find on the playstore. It also makes ads in the browser not load, but the icon where they would be still takes up space on the page.

### Apps 

Blokoda - What I use, blocks ads in most apps and games - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.blokada.alarm/)

DNS66 - Didn't work for me, but I have heard it works for some people - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/)

## Web Browsers with No Ads

[Firefox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) + Ublock Orgin extension

[Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) or use the [F-Droid Repository](https://www.bromite.org/fdroid)
