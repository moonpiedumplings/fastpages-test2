            "content": "Code . questions = [&quot;Is Jeffrey the smartest person alive&quot;] answers = [&quot;yes&quot;] grade = 0 a = 0 for q in questions: answer = input(q) if answer == answers[a]: print(&quot;you are very smart&quot;) grade += 1 else: print(&quot;you are dumb&quot;) a += 1 print(grade,&quot;/&quot;, len(questions)) . you are very smart 1 / 1 . Explanation . My code is much simpler than the example given. By using what is called a for loop, I can repeat the same actions or lines of code (with different inputs) allowing me to have to not type as much. The other thing I am taking advantage of is a list. In python, a list is basically a way to store multiple values. . The syntax of a for loop is for i in j . i is a variable, one which starts at 0 and gets added to until it reaches j. The program runs what is in the for function once, then adds to i, and then repeats until i reaches j. For loops exist in lots of programming languages. . However, I did something special. I created a list called questions, which can store as many questions as I want. I also created a list called answers, which stores anwsers. The for q in questions doesn&#39;t just behave like a normal for loop, the q is not a variable, but rather an item in the list. The function goes through the list with different items. . In addition to that, I set a variable called a. a is used to call on a specific item in the list answers, one that matches the question. By adding 1 to a at the end of the for loop, I can make sure the item called from questions matches with that of answers. . Because of my genius intelligence, I was able to create quiz, that is infinitely extendable. You simply add more items to the list of questions and answers, and more questions and answers will be added. No programming necessary. In addition to that, it also gives a fraction score. . questions = [[&quot;Is Jeffrey the Smartest person alive&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;], [&quot;How many players are there on a football team?&quot;, &quot;11&quot;]] grade = 0 for q in questions: a = input(q[0]) if a == q[1]: print(&quot;Correct&quot;) grade +=1 else: print(&quot;Incorrect&quot;) print(&quot;%&quot;,(grade / len(questions) * 100)) . Correct Correct % 100.0 .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
